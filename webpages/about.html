	<h3>What is this thing?</h3>
	<div class="about">
		<p> SummonSquad.com is a site where you can enter 5 summoner names, and you are given the best possible team based on Mastery Points. You don't want to have to sift through every possible composition to find the best possible team, do you? SummonSquad aims to put each person in their strongest position, with their best champion in that position.  If there are two people who are both top tier junglers, but one of them is garbage everywhere else and the other is pretty good in Mid, then it will put the first person in jungle and the second in mid. The goal of this site is to do all the hard thinking about best possible combinations so you and your team don't have to. <br>Let us know what you think about it! <br><br>

			If you're interested in the implementation of the team building code, reach out to KmancXC on LoL! It uses a basic genetic algorithm to seed team comps and then evolve the seed list until the improvement from one evolution to the next is negligible. We think it's pretty cool =D

	<h3>How did we do it?</h3>
	<div class="about2">
		
		<p> Kmancxc did the back end programming, which is all in python. His goal was to create a webapp where 5 ranked summoners could put in their names, and the app would generate the best possible team based on mastery of champions. Kmancxc asked me if I wanted to help, and I thought it would be a fun learning experience, so I did. In addition to helping Kmancxc bugfix and work through some logic issues, I designed and implemented the user interface. The index page simply takes the summoner names as variables and passes them to the python script, where we use the Riot API to pull all the relevant data and organize it. Currently, it simply returns the summoner name, the champion, and the role. These strings are formatted on the front end to display correctly, and are at the bottom of the second page. When you hover over a summoner, it changes the background of the website to the champion for that summoner. <br>
