# Riot_Challenge_2016

Check us out at [summonsquad.com](http://www.summonsquad.com)!!!!!

The site is designed to take 5 summoner names, a region, and a number of "top champions" to use, and return the best
team that can be made based on the champion mastery scores each summoner has.

It is designed as a Python Flask app, and can be run locally on your machine by simply running `python summonsquad.wsgi`. 

That said, we deployed it on an AWS EC2 instance with Apache

Let us know what you think!
